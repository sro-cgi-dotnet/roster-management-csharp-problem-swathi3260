# Roster Management for a Code School

**Objective**: Given cadet's names along with the wave that they are in, create a roster for the school.
Using the RosterManagement tool you should be able to do the following:  

- Add a cadet's name to the roster for a wave
  - "Add **Jim** to Wave **1**"
- Get a list of all cadets enrolled in a wave
  - "Which **cadet's** are in Wave **1**?" 
  - "We've only got **Jim** just now."
- Get a sorted list of all cadets in all waves. 
- Waves should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and cadet's within a wave should be sorted alphabetically by name.

**Note**: The conversations below are just used to make you understand the problem. The intent is **NOT** to build a conversational agent.
